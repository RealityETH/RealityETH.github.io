Scope of the Audit
==================

RealityCheck is a smart contract system that discovers truth by active disputes with “skin in the game”. A question is asked and a bounty is submitted for a correct answer. Concurrent answers put their own stake at risk. A dedicated arbiter can finally resolve disputes, if required.


Scope of the audit is a corpus of ~700 lines of Solidity:

`https://github.com/realitykeys/realitycheck/blob/master/truffle/contracts/Arbitrator.sol <https://github.com/realitykeys/realitycheck/blob/master/truffle/contracts/Arbitrator.sol>`_

`https://github.com/realitykeys/realitycheck/blob/207278cecb4a99709dd7e6c1b601196ba11e676e/truffle/contracts/RealityCheck.sol <https://github.com/realitykeys/realitycheck/blob/207278cecb4a99709dd7e6c1b601196ba11e676e/truffle/contracts/RealityCheck.sol>`_


Deployment, UI and other external modules are not part of the audit and can introduce vulnerabilities.
