Methodology
===========

Structured reading is the main method of assessment. The code has been read twice, (1) line by line from start to end focusing on local errors, gas consumption and efficiency. (2) the second time was during a one day workshop together with the ideator and implementer Edmund Edgar and Smart Contract Auditor Alex Kampa. The aim of this workshop was to uncover more sophisticated vulnerabilities due to timing, network constraints and economic imbalances.

The following definitions of alert levels are adopted to label vulnerabilities.


CRITICAL
has potential to harm user or owner

MEDIUM
has potential to impede proper functioning of the smart contract

MINOR
there is a better way to do this or is just a matter of diverging tastes
