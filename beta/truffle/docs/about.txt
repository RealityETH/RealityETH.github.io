We're releasing Reality Check, an Ethereum-based participatory data service. 

This is designed with smart contracts in mind, but it may also be useful for humans and other intelligent agents.

Reality Check is the next step in the evolution of the Reality Keys service we've been running since early 2014.

You can also use it in combination with a fully-automated oracle service like SmartContract.com or Oraclize.



How to use it
 * Send our contract a question, along with the reward you are willing to pay for someone to answer it. 
   You can also specify the address of a contract that will serve as the ultimate arbitrator, for an additional fee; If you don't, it will use our own trusted-human-based oracle contract.
 * If you see a question you know the answer to, send the contract the answer, along with a bond that you will forfeit if you're wrong.
 * If you see that someone else has given the wrong answer, send the right answer to your contract, along a bond at least twice as big as theirs.
 * If you see someone outbid your answer with the wrong answer, you can top up your bond to outbid theirs.
 * If you think the contract is poised to about on an incorrect answer, pay the arbitration contract.
 * Once the time limit has elapsed or the arbitration contract has responded, the person who gave the correct answer gets paid. They'll get their bond, the question reward and the bonds of anyone who gave the wrong answer.
 * Once an issue is settled, you can query the contract for the answer.

Callbacks to your contract
 * You can send a bounty for someone to send the answer to your contract. You can top up this bounty at any time.
   (If you know when you want your contract to be called, we recommend that you use the Ethereum Alarm Clock instead, which has more features.)
