Realitio is now live on mainnet. This is a fully-functional release, and we do not have a backdoor to stop or change it.

We are currently the only arbitrator listed in the dapp, but other people are free to create arbitrator contracts of their own.

We will be starting with a fairly low dispute fee of 1 ETH, and gradually increasing to around 10 ETH.
